This is a desktop application for playing audio files that I made using Electron and Vue. It was my first time using Electron and this was largely a learning experience, which I undertook due to my curiosity for the technology. Vue was not entirely new to me, I had briefly used it in my university Javascript course, but I wanted to refresh my knowledge.

What makes this application different from many others of its kind is the extent to which the user is able to customize the app's UI - the color of any given UI element can be changed to whatever hex value the user wants.

# Thoughts on Electron
I had a lot of fun making this project and I found Electron to be quite intuitive. I am aware that Electron is often criticized for large file sizes and high memory usage, but being able to write cross-platform desktop applications with web technology is very neat in my opinion. I think there are some contexts where it might make sense to use Electron over something like Flutter. For example when you already have a web application and you want to create a desktop version for it, then using Electron would likely result in much quicker development.

# Closing thoughts
The project in its current state is what I would call a minimum viable product and I will certainly keep developing this in the future. I have listed a few potential developments I have considered for the future below:

- external audio sources
- support for multiple audio sources
- support for file tags
- search, sort, filtering for tracks
- more customization options
