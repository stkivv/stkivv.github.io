		<p>
			This is a project that I made as part of the 'Distributed Systems' and
			'Javascript' courses in Tallinn University of Technology.
		</p>
		<p>
			The frontend for this project is written in React and the backend is
			made with .NET, with a PostgreSQL database.
		</p>
		<p>
			We were given quite a bit of freedom when making this project, each of
			us was allowed to pick what kind of web app we wanted to make and what
			sort of features we wanted to implement. For many students, this project
			became the basis for their final thesis.
		</p>
		<p>
			I decided to make a webapp for helping with houseplant management. It
			helps with tasks such as keeping track of the watering cycle,
			categorizing different plants and marking down any diseases/pests on the
			plants.
		</p>
		<p>
			The finalized web app was containerized with Docker and deployed to
			Microsoft Azure. However, it is no longer live because the project is
			not being maintained.
