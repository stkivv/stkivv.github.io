      <p>
        This is a desktop application for playing audio files that I made using
        Electron and Vue. It was my first time using Electron and this was
        largely a learning experience, which I undertook due to my curiosity for
        the technology. Vue was not entirely new to me, I had briefly used it in
        my university Javascript course, but I wanted to refresh my knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        This application supports all standard playback options (shuffle,
        repeat, skip, etc) and provides a minimalistic, intuitive UI. What makes
        this application different from many others of its kind is the extent to
        which the user is able to customize the app's UI - the color of any
        given UI element can be changed to whatever hex value the user wants.
      </p>
      <p>
        While a browser usually would not allow you to load files from the users
        machine (unless the user explicitly selects them), it is possible in
        Electron by using the Node.js file system module in the main process.
        This data can then be sent to the renderer process through IPC
        (Inter-Process Communication). In my renderer process I was able to make
        use of a hidden HTML audio element for handling playback. This element
        also has a 'timeupdate' event which is used to update the UI and an
        'ended' event which is used to trigger the playback of the next track. A
        history of played tracks is kept, so that the user can move through it
        backwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I previously mentioned, the color of any UI element can be changed
        through the settings. For this I used CSS variables, an interface with
        the same fields and a mapping between the two. When a value in the
        setting JSON changes, the value is applied to the corresponding CSS
        variable. The settings JSON is saved to localStorage.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had a lot of fun making this project and I found Electron to be quite
        intuitive. I am aware that Electron is often criticized for large file
        sizes and high memory usage, but being able to write cross-platform
        desktop applications with web technology is very neat in my opinion. I
        think there are some contexts where it might make sense to use Electron
        over something like Flutter. For example when you already have a web
        application and you want to create a desktop version for it, then using
        Electron would likely result in much quicker development.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project in its current state is what I would call a minimum viable
        product and I will certainly keep developing this in the future. I have
        listed a few potential developments I have considered for the future
        below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>external audio sources</li>
        <li>support for multiple audio sources</li>
        <li>support for file tags</li>
        <li>search, sort, filtering for tracks</li>
        <li>more customization options</li>
      </ul>
