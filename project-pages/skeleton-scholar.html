        This is a project I made as part of my final thesis in Tallinn
        University of Technology. It is an Android application for learning
        anatomy with the help of 3D models. The full thesis is available to read
        in Estonian

        This application is intended for studying anatomical terms through
        interactive learning. It features an anatomically correct 3D model of a
        human skeleton that can be rotated, scaled and moved freely in 3D space.
        By selecting different parts of the model, the user can see the
        anatomical term associated with the bodypart in either estonian or
        english.
      </p>
      <p>
        I first analyzed different methods that can be used for displaying 3D
        models on Android devices in order to determine the most suitable
        technology for this project. For this I created 3 separate prototype
        applications using different technologies and tested their performace,
        as well as evaluated how difficult they were to develop. The results are
        combined in the table below:
      </p>
      <table>
        <tr>
          <th>Used technology</th>
          <th>Application size (MB)</th>
          <th>Framerate (FPS)</th>
          <th>GPU memory use (MB)</th>
          <th>subjective evaulation of difficulty</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Sceneview</td>
          <td>33.38</td>
          <td>60</td>
          <td>78.6</td>
          <td>Medium</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Babylon React Native</td>
          <td>124.0</td>
          <td>60, but freezes on interaction</td>
          <td>61.0</td>
          <td>Difficult</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Unity</td>
          <td>65.18</td>
          <td>60</td>
          <td>53.1</td>
          <td>Easy</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <p>
        Based on these results, I decided that Unity is the most appropriate
        tool to use. I then wrote down a list of requirements and tested a few
        analogous applications to determine potential UX problems that apps like
        this may have.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 3D models I used originate from the website
        <a href="https://lifesciencedb.jp/bp3d/?lng=en">BodyParts3D</a>, which
        is managed by DBCLS (Database Center for Life Science, a Japanese
        research institute). The models are distributed under the CC BY-SA 2.1
        JP license. I modified the models to reduce polycount and fix visual
        errors.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 3D view of my app, I apply all transformations on the camera
        object and the 3D model itself is static in the scene. The user cannot
        tell the difference, but it makes certain things easier for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Object scaling and view drag are pretty straightforward. For scaling, I
        calculate the distance between the two touch points and I compare it to
        the same distance on previous render. View drag works similarly, only
        here the touch positions are used to find the movement vector instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rotation was the most difficult of the 3D transformations because it
        requires some level of understanding of both quaternion and Euler
        rotations. In my app I keep the X and Y rotation in variables and add or
        remove from them whenever I drag with my finger. Rotation is calculated
        from the starting position, based on the values of these variables.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted the app to support both English and Estonian. I used CSV files
        for handling translation (each row in a file is a key-value pair, where
        the key is the name of the 3D object and value is the corresponding
        anatomical term). To make the CSV files I wrote a python script that
        calls the google translate API. Of course there were many
        mistranslations which had to be manually corrected, but it gave me a
        base to work with. The app is designed in such a way that adding new
        translations is as simple as creating a new CSV, placing it in the
        appropriate folder, and rebuilding the project.
      </p>
      <p>
        I continued working on this project even after defending my thesis and I
        was very close to publishing it on Google Play. Unfortuanetly I got
        frustrated with their 20 tester requirement and lost interest in
        publishing on their platform as a result. Before quitting I managed to
        reach 12 testers and their feedback was very positive.
